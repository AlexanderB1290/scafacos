% This is an illustration of the splitting of the Coulomb interactions into a
% short- and a long-range part. It has been created with TikZ and is modelled
% after an illustration in [Griebel, Knapek, Zumbusch - "Numerical Simulation 
% in Molecular Dynamics -- Numerics, Algorithms, Parallelization,
% Applications", 2007]
%
% Note that gnuplot is required to create the exponential peaks. Please refer
% to the documentation of TikZ.
