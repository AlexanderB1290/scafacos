  abstract = {We derive and describe in detail a recently proposed method for obtaining
	Coulomb interactions as the potential of mean force between charges
	which are dynamically coupled to a local electromagnetic field. We
	focus on the molecular dynamics version of the method and show that
	it is intimately related to the Car-Parrinello approach, while being
	equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations with a freely adjustable
	speed of light. Unphysical self-energies arise as a result of the
	lattice interpolation of charges, and are corrected by a subtraction
	scheme based on the exact lattice Green function. The method can
	be straightforwardly parallelized using standard domain decomposition.
	Some preliminary benchmark results are presented.},
