PP3MG implements a multigrid method solver. The particle charges are
interpolated to a regular grid. The long-range part is then solved via
solving the Poisson equation, using finite difference/finite volume
discretization. The short-range part is computed directly.

\begin{verbatim}
Parameters:

  - too many, too poorly documented
    rather use meaningful defaults, or values already known in the handle

Box Shape / Periodicity

  - open or mixed boundaries:  is this supported? for what boxes?
  - periodic boundaries:       only rectangular or cubic boxes?

Can Delegate Nearfield to MD:  currently not

Bugs / Missing Features:

  - remove superfluous parameters like periodicity or mpi_dims;
    these are already known in the handle
  - provide meaningful defaults for parameters like mesh sizes or
    workspace size
  - document what the remaining parameters mean, and give rules
    how to choose reasonable values
  - crashes - doesn't appear to work at present, except for 8 atom
    sample in unit cube
  - excessive use of pow function - this is slow
  - should use solution of previos MD step as start for the iteration
