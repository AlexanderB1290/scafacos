\begin{verbatim}
Parameters

  - absrel: absolute or relative energy errors 
       0 = relative energy error 10^{-3} (default) 
       1 = absolute energy error deltaE 
       2 = relative energy error deltaE 

  - deltaE: relative or absolute energy error, depending on absrel
       absrel = 1: absolute total energy error 
       absrel = 2: relative energy error, 10^{-1}...10^{-14}

  - dipole_correction: type of dipole correction to use (explain!)
      currently ignored (not handed over by interface)
      -1 = no dipole correction
       0 = standard dipole correction
       1 = dipole correction activated
       default value?

Box Shape / Periodicity

  - open boundaries:               full support for any box shape

  - periodic or mixed boundaries:  support limited to cubic boxes;
                                   however, for mixed boundaries, 
                                   edges in non-periodic directions 
                                   may be shorter than periodic edges

Can Delegate Nearfield to MD:  no

Bugs / Missing Features

  - only backup version of virial tensor with periodic boundaries
  - can we lift the requirements for periodic or mixed boundaries
    to approximately cubic boxes, like for PEPC?
  - does not compile with Intel compiler
