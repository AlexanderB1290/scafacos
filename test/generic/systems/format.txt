The ScaFaCoS XML Testcase format
--------------------------------
Time-stamp: <2011-11-10 17:38 olenz>

Element: 
  <scafacos_test>
Description:
  Top level element
Attributes:
  name: Text 
    Name of the testcase
  description: Text
    One-line description of the testcase
  reference_method: Text
    The method that was used to compute the reference forces and
    potentials in the testcase.
  error_field: Float 
    Estimated maximal error of the reference field values.
  error_potential: Float
    Estimated maximal error of the reference potential values.
Child elements:
  <configuration>*

Element:
  <configuration>
Description:
  A single configuration. A testcase may contain several
  configurations.
Attributes:
  offset: Float[3]
    Offset of the system box.
    If the system is not periodic, this value is ignored.
  box_a, box_b, box_c: Float[3]
    Unitcell vectors of the system. 
    If the system is not periodic in the given dimension, this value
    is ignored.
  periodicity: Bool[3]
    Periodicity of the configuration.
    Whether or not the system is periodic in the given direction.
  epsilon: Float | "metallic"
    The value of the dielectric permitivity of the boundary of the
    system. If it is infinite (metallic boundary conditions), use
    "metallic".
Child elements:
  <particle>*

Element:
  <particle>
Description:
  A single particle. A configuration contains several particles.
Attributes:
  position: Float[3]
    Position of the particle.
    Note that in the periodic case the position does *not* have to be
    in the central image.
  q: Float
    Charge of the particle.
    A value of 0.0 just means that it does not carry a charge, still
    the potential and field is to be computed at the position.
  potential: Float
    Reference potential at the position of the particle.
    The potential should have been computed with the method
    scafacos_test.reference_method to a level of accuracy defined by
    scafacos_test.error_potential.
  field: Float[3]
    Reference field at the position of the particle.
    The field should have been computed with the method
    scafacos_test.reference_method to a level of accuracy defined by
    scafacos_test.error_field.
